Free IPv6 tunneling services from SixXS (http://www.sixxs.net) and Hurricane Electric (http://www.he.net) offer IPv4-to-IPv6 tunneled access with a static IPv6 address. Configuring a Linux host to create a tunnel with SixXS or Hurricane Electric starts with creating an account on the respective provider's website and then configuring your Linux host to establish a tunnel. A step-by-step guide for configuring Ubuntu Linux (including Kali Linux) for SixXS or Hurricane Electric tunneling is available at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/IPv6.

A simpler IPv6 tunnel option for Linux systems is to use the IPv6 Teredo tunneling protocol with the "miredo" daemon. Simply **starting the miredo process** on most Linux distributions **will be sufficient to establish an IPv6 connection**, **allowing you to ping IPv6 hosts** such as ipv6.google.com. Once the Teredo tunnel is established, other scanning tools such as Nmap will also allow you to scan and enumerate remote IPv6 targets.
