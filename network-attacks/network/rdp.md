## <mark style="color:red;">RDP MitM</mark>

{% embed url="https://github.com/SySS-Research/Seth" %}

Seth is a tool written in Python and Bash to MitM RDP connections by attempting to downgrade the connection in order to extract clear text credentials. It was developed to raise awareness and educate about the importance of properly configured RDP connections in the context of pentests, workshops or talks. The author is Adrian Vollmer (SySS GmbH).

```
git clone https://github.com/SySS-Research/Seth.git
cd Seth 
pip install -r requirements.txt

./seth.sh <INTERFACE> <ATTACKER IP> <VICTIM IP> <GATEWAY IP|HOST IP> [<COMMAND>] 
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: The last IP address must be that of the gateway, this can only change if the victimâ€™s computer shares a subnet with the RDP host.
{% endhint %}

The last parameter is optional. It can contain a command that is executed on the RDP host by simulating WIN+R via key press event injection. Keystroke injection depends on which keyboard layout the victim is using - currently it's only reliable with the English US layout. I suggest avoiding special characters by using `powershell -enc <STRING>`, where STRING is your UTF-16le and Base64 encoded command. However, `calc` should be pretty universal and gets the job done.

\
The shell script performs ARP spoofing to gain a Man-in-the-Middle position and redirects the traffic such that it runs through an RDP proxy. The proxy can be called separately. This can be useful if you want use Seth in combination with Responder. Use Responder to gain a Man-in-the-Middle position and run Seth at the same time. Run seth.py -h for more information.
