## :information\_source: <mark style="color:blue;">Introduction</mark>

#### [Internet Protocol Version 6](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8200)

{% hint style="info" %}
The presence of an inet6 entry doesnâ€™t automatically mean the computer is accessible from external addresses.
{% endhint %}

An Ipv6 address uses 128 bits as opposed to 32 bits in IPv4.

IPv6 addresses are written using hexadecimal, as opposed to dotted decimal in IPv4

Because an hexadecimal number uses 4 bits this means that an IPv6 address consists of 32 hexadecimal numbers.

#### <mark style="color:green;">These numbers are grouped in 4â€™s giving 8 groups or blocks. The groups are written with a : (colon) as a separator.</mark>

#### `group1:group2: â€¦â€¦etcâ€¦. :group8`

Here is an IPv6 address example:

Broadcast addresses are no longer used in IPv6, replaced with multicast addresses. If an IPv6 host wants to send traffic to all the hosts on the LAN, which would have formerly used a broadcast IPv4 address and an `FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF` MAC address, the host uses the `FF02::1 IPv6` address with a destination MAC address of `33:33:00:00:00:01`

#### <mark style="color:green;">Common IPv6 addresses include the following:</mark>

<mark style="color:orange;">**FE80::/10**</mark> â€“ Link local (analogous to IPv4 169.254.0.0/16 address space defined in RFC 5735 and RFC 3927)

<mark style="color:orange;">**FC00::/7**</mark> â€“ Unique local address (analogous to IPv4 192.168.0.0/16, 10.0.0.0/8, and 172.16.0.0/12 address space defined in RFC 1918)

<mark style="color:orange;">**FF00::/8**</mark> â€“ Multicast IPv6 traffic

<mark style="color:orange;">**FF02::1/64**</mark> â€“ All nodes multicast address, replacing IPv4 broadcast address 255.255.255.255

<mark style="color:orange;">**2000::/16**</mark> â€“ Used for stateless autoconfiguration of IPv6 addresses using the EUI 64 expansion method, leveraging the client MAC address

<mark style="color:orange;">**2001::/16**</mark> â€“ Internet-wide global allocation of IPv6 address space to regional registries (analogous to the former IPv4 unique organizational address space allocations, such as 4.0.0.0/8, 64.24.0.0/16, and so on)

<mark style="color:orange;">**2001:db8::/32**</mark> â€“ Used for documentation purposes

{% hint style="info" %}
Because of the length of IPv6 addresses various shortening techniques are employed.

The main technique being to omit repetitive 0â€™s as shown in the example above.
{% endhint %}

In IPv4 an address is split into two components a network component and a node component.

This was done initially using Address classes and later using subnet masking.

In IPv6 we do the same. The first step is to split the address into two parts.

The address is split into 2 64 bit segments the top 64 bits is the network part and the lower 64 bits the node part:

### <mark style="color:orange;">Address Types and Scope</mark>

IPv6 addresses have three types:

* **Global Unicast Address** â€“Scope Internet- routed on Internet
* **Unique Local** â€” Scope Internal Network or VPN internally routable, but **Not routed** on Internet
* **Link Local** â€“ Scope network link- **Not Routed** internally or externally.

### <mark style="color:orange;">IPv6 Loop Back</mark>

The IPv6 loopback address is ::1. You can ping it as follows:

```
ping ::1
```
