# ðŸŸ¨ Rlogin

#### This service was mostly used in the old days for remote administration but now because of security issues this service has been replaced by the slogin and the ssh.

{% hint style="info" %}
rlogin runs on TCP port 513. its highly unlikely to see this service out in the open these days, but if you do, its your lucky day because if a system with an open rlogin service is exposed to the internet then there are probably more dangerous and vulnerable services running on that network.
