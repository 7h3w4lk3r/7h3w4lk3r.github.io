### VOIP Protocols

The most common VoIP protocols are listed as follows:

| VoIP Protocol                                                                                   | Summary                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Authenticated Identity Body (AIB)                                                               | This is a method of sharing authenticated identity with parties in the network and uses a special MIME format. Works in conjunction with SIP S/MIME. Discussed in RFC 3893                                                                |

It prevents any potential for excessive voice calls and protects existing voice traffic. |

Discussed in detail in RFC 3525.                   |
| H.323                                                                                           | Commonly used by telecom equipment manufacturers and service providers.

Master/Slave protocol. The core RFC for MGP is RFC 3435 and there are also a number of related RFCs.              |
| Network Voice Protocol                                                                          | Early version of Voice over Internet Protocol.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
