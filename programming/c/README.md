# ðŸ”´ C Programming

#### C might sound a bit old when it comes to the new era of coding and software development specially when the social media and software companies are filled with web developers/designers, AI and ML folks and so-called data scientists. but when it comes to software security, reversing and exploit development, C is the first language to know simply because its the only low-level language with a high-level syntax that was specifically designed for developing operating systems and system programming and it teaches you everything you need to know about how computers work and how you can manage and manipulate memory. for windows reversing you will probably face C++ desktop apps more but we start with Linux because it always makes things easier for beginners and its FOSS :)

#### Here i tried to make a simple and useful tutorial about C, for C++ i will only talk about the differences and OOP because C++ is a superset of C and these two have the same concepts, except for a few things the basics are pretty much the same in both of these and i highly recommend you start with C before moving to c++ or Java. this way you fully understand the concepts of program execution and how the whole system works which will definitely help you later.
