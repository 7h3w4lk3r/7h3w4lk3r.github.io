### <mark style="color:orange;">Create User</mark>

```
useradd [username]

# options
-g   Main user group (gid)
-d   User Home directory, by default located at /home/<UserName>
-m  Create Home directory in case it doesn’t exist.
-s   Assign a specific shell to the user, by default it is /bin/bash.
-M dont create home directory

# example:
useradd -g sector1 -d /home/nicolas -m -s /bin/bash nicolas
sudo useradd -G wheel -m -d /home/frank -s /bin/bash frank


adduser [username]
```

{% hint style="info" %}
While the command useradd runs a system binary file the command adduser is a perl script to interact with useradd With the adduser command, the advantage is the home is created automatically. If using the command adduser we need to specify the -m option.

you can set the number of days before an account with an expired password will get locked out:

```
sudo usermod -f 5 charlie
```

  -M, --maxdays MAX_DAYS        set maximum number of days before password
  -W, --warndays WARN_DAYS      set expiration warning days to WARN_DAYS
  -d, --lastday LAST_DAY        set date of last password change to LAST_DAY

chage -M 20 john

chage -E 2020-12-31 charlie
```

### <mark style="color:orange;">Default Account Aging</mark>

for Red Hat or CentOS only

```
/etc/default/useradd

# useradd defaults file
GROUP=100
HOME=/home
INACTIVE=-1
EXPIRE=
SHELL=/bin/bash
SKEL=/etc/skel
CREATE_MAIL_SPOOL=yes
```

Ubuntu also has the useradd configuration file, but it doesn't work. No matter how you configure it, the Ubuntu version of useradd just won't read it. So, the write-up about this file only applies to Red Hat or CentOS.

## <mark style="color:red;">**Configure Password complexity with pam**</mark>

### <mark style="color:orange;">Debian-based</mark>

Ensuring that password meets a certain degree of complexity is equally crucial and further thwarts any attempts by hackers to infiltrate your system using brute force.

As a general rule, a strong password should have a combination of Uppercase, lowercase, numeric and special characters and should be at least 12-15 characters long.

To enforce password complexity in Debian / Ubuntu systems, you need to install the `libpam-pwquality` package as shown:

```
sudo apt install libpam-pwquality
```

Once installed, head out to the `/etc/pam.d/common-password` file from where you are going to set the password policies. Be default, the file appears as shown:

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (287).png>)

Locate the line shown below

```
password   requisite   pam_pwquality.so retry=3
```

Add the following attributes to the line:

```
minlen=12 maxrepeat=3 ucredit=-1 lcredit=-1 dcredit=-1 ocredit=-1 difok=4 reject_username enforce_for_root
```

The entire line should appear as shown:

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (292).png>)

#### Let’s flesh out what these directives stand for:

* retry=3: This option will prompt the user 3 times before exiting and returning an error.
* minlen=12: This specifies that the password cannot be less than 12 characters.
* maxrepeat=3: This allows implies that only a maximum of 3 repeated characters can be included in the password.
* ucredit=-1: The option requires at least one uppercase character in the password.
* lcredit=-1: The option requires at least one lowercase character in the password.
* dcredit=-1: This implies that the password should have at last a numeric character.
* ocredit=-1: The option requires at least one special character included in the password.
* difok=3: This implies that only a maximum of 3 character changes in the new password should be present in the old password.
* reject\_username: The option rejects a password if it consists of the username either in its normal way or in reverse.
* enforce\_for\_root: This ensures that the password policies are adhered to even if it’s the root user configuring the passwords.

### <mark style="color:orange;">Redhat-based</mark>

For Debian and Ubuntu systems, we enforced the password policy by making changes to the **/etc/pam.d/common-password** configuration file.

For CentOS 7 and other derivatives, we are going to modify the **`/etc/pam.d/system-auth`** or **`/etc/security/pwquality.conf`**\` \`\`\` configuration file.

So, proceed and open the file:

```
sudo vim /etc/pam.d/system-auth
```

Locate the line shown below

```
password    requisite     pam_pwquality.so try_first_pass local_users_only retry=3 authtok_type=
```

Append the options in the line as shown.

```
minlen=12 lcredit=-1 ucredit=-1 dcredit=-1 ocredit=-1 enforce_for_root
```

You will end up having the line below:

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (288).png>)

Once done, save the password policies and exit the file.

Once again, when you try creating a user with a weak password that doesn’t adhere to the enforced policies, you will encounter the error shown in the terminal.

## <mark style="color:red;">Configure Root Access</mark>

you can disable root logins entirely by setting root’s encrypted password to \* or to some other fixed, arbitrary string. On Linux, passwd -l “locks” an account by prepending a ! to the encrypted password, with equivalent results. The \* and the ! are just conventions; no software checks for them explicitly. Their effect derives from their not being valid password hashes. As a result, attempts to verify root’s password simply fail.

## <mark style="color:red;">Manually Adding Users</mark>

#### Edit `/etc/passwd` with view and add a new line for the new account. Be careful with the syntax. Do not edit directly with an editor! vipw locks the file, so that other commands won't try to update it at the same time. You should make the password field be \`\*', so that it is impossible to log in.

#### Similarly, edit `/etc/group` if you need to create a new group as well.

#### Create the home directory of the user with mkdir.

#### Copy the files from `/etc/skel` to the new home directory.

Fix ownerships and permissions with chown and chmod. The -R option is most useful. The correct permissions vary a little from one site to another, but usually the following commands do the right thing:

```
cd /home/newusername
chown -R username.group .
chmod -R go=u,go-w .
chmod go= .
```

#### Set the password with passwd.
