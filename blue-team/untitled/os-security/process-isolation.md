## <mark style="color:red;">Preventing users from seeing each others' processes</mark>

By default, users can use a utility such as ps or top to see everyone else's processes, as well as their own.

the best way to deal with this is to mount the /proc filesystem with the hidepid option. You can do this by adding the following line to the end of the /etc/fstab file, like so:

`nano /etc/fstab`

```
proc    /proc   proc    hidepid=2   0   0
```

Then, remount /proc , like so:

```
sudo mount -o remount proc
```

Now, any user who doesn't have sudo privileges can only view his or her own processes.

The three values for the hidepid option are as follows:

<mark style="color:orange;">0 :</mark> This is the default, which allows all users to see each others' processes.

<mark style="color:orange;">1 :</mark> This allows all users to see other users' process directories within /proc . However, users will only be able to cd into their own process directories. Also, they'll only be able to see their own process information with ps or top .

<mark style="color:orange;">2 :</mark> This hides all other users' process information, including the process directories within /proc .

## <mark style="color:red;">Restrict Core Dumps</mark>

A core dump is the memory of an executable program. It is generally used to determine why a program aborted. It can also be used to glean confidential information from a core file. The system provides the ability to set a soft limit for core dumps, but this can be overridden by the user.

Setting a hard limit on core dumps prevents users from overriding the soft variable. If core dumps are required, consider setting limits for user groups (see limits.conf(5) ). In addition, setting the fs.suid\_dumpable variable to 0 will prevent setuid programs from dumping core.

Run the following commands and verify output matches:

```
# grep "hard core" /etc/security/limits.conf /etc/security/limits.d/*
* hard core 0

# sysctl fs.suid_dumpable
fs.suid_dumpable = 0

# grep "fs\.suid_dumpable" /etc/sysctl.conf /etc/sysctl.d/*
fs.suid_dumpable = 0
```

Run the following command to check if systemd-coredump is installed:

```
# systemctl is-enabled coredump.service
```

if enabled or disabled is returned systemd-coredump is installed

Add the following line to /etc/security/limits.conf or a /etc/security/limits.d/\* file:

```
* hard core 0
```

Set the following parameter in /etc/sysctl.conf or a /etc/sysctl.d/\* file:

```
fs.suid_dumpable = 0
```

Run the following command to set the active kernel parameter:

```
sysctl -w fs.suid_dumpable=0
```

If systemd-coredump is installed:

edit `/etc/systemd/coredump.conf` and add/modify the following lines:

```
Storage=none
ProcessSizeMax=0
```

Run the command:

```
systemctl daemon-reload
```

## <mark style="color:red;">Enable Exploit Mitigation Mechanisms</mark>

### <mark style="color:orange;">ASLR</mark>

Set the following parameter in `/etc/sysctl.conf` or a `/etc/sysctl.d/*` file:

```
kernel.randomize_va_space = 2 
```

Run the following command to set the active kernel parameter:

```
sysctl -w kernel.randomize_va_space=2
```

## <mark style="color:red;">Disable Prelink</mark>

prelink is a program that modifies ELF shared libraries and ELF dynamically linked binaries in such a way that the time needed for the dynamic linker to perform relocations at startup significantly decreases.

{% hint style="info" %}
The prelinking feature can interfere with the operation of AIDE, because it changes binaries. Prelinking can also increase the vulnerability of the system if a malicious user is able to compromise a common library such as libc
{% endhint %}

Verify prelink is not installed. Depending on the package management in use one of the following commands may provide the needed information:

```
# rpm -q prelink
# dpkg -s prelink
```

Run the following command to restore binaries to normal:

```
prelink -ua
```

Uninstall prelink using the appropriate package manager or manual installation:

```
# yum remove prelink
# apt-get remove prelink
# zypper remove prelink
```
