# ðŸ”§ Code Execution & Payload Placement

## <mark style="color:red;">Shellcode Loaders / Wrappers</mark>

As the name suggests, a loader is a program that loads a specific payload in memory ( could be its own memory or the memory of another process, A.K.A: code injection) and executes the code. this payload is usually a C2 agent shellcode in an encrypted / encoded format which gets decrypted / decoded before being loaded in memory. so basically a loader.
