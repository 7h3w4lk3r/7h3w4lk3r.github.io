WAF stands for Web Application Firewall. Its goal is to protect the website behind it by filtering/monitoring the traffic. Fingerprinting is a method used to gather information (about any WAF in this context).

#### Detecting WAFs with [nmap](https://nmap.org).

```
nmap -p 80,443 --script=http-waf-fingerprint $URL

## <mark style="color:red;">Other examples</mark> <a href="#other-examples" id="other-examples"></a>

A manual testing workflow could be to check the cookies and response headers.

**Cookies**: some WAF can be identified by the cookie's name. **Response headers**: sometimes they are changed to apparently "confuse the attacker".
