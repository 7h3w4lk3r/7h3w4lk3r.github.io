#### Ultimate Facebook Scraper <a href="#ultimate-facebook-scraper" id="ultimate-facebook-scraper"></a>

```
# Python automated script used to scrape and parse data from a Facebook account
# You need to provide your credentials (dedicated account) and targets as input in "input.txt".

# Limits : 
# - If the profile target is configured and not in your friends, you may see nothing
# - If you request too much profiles, Facebook can block requests, resulting in crash
# - If target profiles are big, can be very long an resources hungry

# Results are stored in txt format, easily grepable by dates for examples.
```

#### Facebook Graph Search <a href="#facebook-graph-search" id="facebook-graph-search"></a>

```
# Graph Search is a Facebook internal search engine used to get precise results when searching
# Facebook need to be in English version to activate the Graph Search

# On June 2019, Facebook shut down its Graph Search options.
# The ‘new’ Graph Search seems a little comprehensive at first
# but it’s pretty easy once you get the hang of it. It involves some JSON and Base64.

```

```
# Identifiers are always required to performs queries
# CTRL+U on page, profile, group...
# CTFL+F 
# "entity_id" = Profile 
# "page_id" = Page
# "group_id" = Group

# EVERY Facebook requests start like this
facebook.com/search/top/?q=people&epa=FILTERS&filters=

# top/  Search top content
# posts/    Search public posts
# people/   Search for people
# photos/   Search for photos
# videos/   Search for videos
# pages/    Search for pages
# places/   Search for places

# And then the content of the query
facebook.com/search/posts/?q=baseball&epa=FILTERS&filters=

# It uses then JSON and BASE64 to apply filters
# For example, the JSON string for "most recent" is
{“rp_chrono_sort”:”{\”name\”:\”chronosort\”,\”args\”:\”\”}”}

# Then base64 encode it
facebook.com/search/posts/?q=baseball&epa=FILTERS&filters=<BASE64>

# You can also perform combined queries
# Example : From one city and one employer
{“city”:”{\”name\”:\”users_location\”,\”args\”:\”108212625870265\”}”}
{“employer”:”{\”name\”:\”users_employer\”,\”args\”:\”104958162837\”}”}
# Result
{“city”:”{\”name\”:\”users_location\”,\”args\”:\”108212625870265\”}”,”employer”:”{\”name\”:\”users_employer\”,\”args\”:\”104958162837\”}”}

# Think about testing queries
https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/

# And then concat with a classic query
facebook.com/search/posts/?q=baseball&epa=FILTERS&filters=<BASE64>

# Some queries
# Most recent populair content
{“rp_chrono_sort”:”{\”name\”:\”chronosort\”,\”args\”:\”\”}”}

# Most populair public content
{“rp_author”:”{\”name\”:\”merged_public_posts\”,\”args\”:\”\”}”}

# Most populair content viewed by your profile
{“interacted_posts”:”{\”name\”:\”interacted_posts\”,\”args\”:\”\”}”}

# Posts from your friends
{“rp_author”:”{\”name\”:\”author_friends_feed\”,\”args\”:\”\”}”}

# Posts from the pages you like and the groups you are a member of
{“rp_author”:”{\”name\”:\”my_groups_and_pages_posts\”,\”args\”:\”\”}”}

# People who work at a specific employer
{“employer”:”{\”name\”:\”users_employer\”,\”args\”:\”PutIDHere\”}”}

# Photos viewed by your profile
{“interacted_posts”:”{\”name\”:\”interacted_posts\”,\”args\”:\”\”}”}

# Photos posted by your friends
{“rp_author”:”{\”name\”:\”author_friends_feed\”,\”args\”:\”\”}”}
