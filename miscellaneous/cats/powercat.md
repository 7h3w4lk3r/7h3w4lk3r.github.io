Powercat is essentially the PowerShell version of Netcat. It is a script we can download to a Windows host to leverage the strengths of PowerShell and simplifies the creation of bind/reverse shells.

Powercat can be installed in Kali with `apt install powercat` , which will place the script in `/usr/share/windows-resources/powercat`
